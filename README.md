# Decentralized Teller Machine (DTM) is a "concept project" which features a hardware device developed with a smart contract (written in Solidity high-level programming language) that solves the major frictions encountered with Automated Teller Machine (ATM).



# _Benefits of a Decentralized Teller Machine (DTM) over Automated Teller Machine (ATM):_

i. Stores data on Ethereum blockchian and is highly secured unlike ATM that can easily be hacked because of its centralized sever.

ii. Decentralized Teller Machine (DTM) begins with a key digital input for user address (i.e. private key) thereby improving user experience unlike ATM that swallows users' debit/credit cards.

iii. DTM ensures a seamless transaction as against Automated Teller Machine (ATM) that can record a debit transaction without payment.



# _Other Digital Inputs / Control To Actions (CTA):_
There are only three (3) Control To Actions in DTM namely;

i. Withdraw Money: This function modifies the state of the blockchain and will only run if the user balance is greater than the amount requested before converting the user's crytocurrency to his/her country-native currency such as Nigerian Naira.

ii. Send Money: This function takes an input such as a recipient's public address and amount to be sent and like Withdraw Money CTA, it modifies the state of the blockchain.

iii. Check Balance: This function does not modify the state of the blockchain and allows a user to view the current balance he/she holds stored on the blockchain.
